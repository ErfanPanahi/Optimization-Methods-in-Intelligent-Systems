# Optimization-Methods-in-Intelligent-Systems
In this repository, I intend to address the implementation of various optimization methods. In the first section, binary logistic regression is employed for classifying MNIST dataset. The second part focuses on optimizing a non-convex objective function, and finally, in the third section, we become familiar with SVM.
