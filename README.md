# Optimization-Methods-in-Intelligent-Systems
In this repository, I intend to focus on implementing various optimization methods. The first section employs binary logistic regression for classifying MNIST dataset. The second section deals with optimizing a non-convex cost function, using the genetic algorithm for this purpose. Lastly, in the third section, we acquaint ourselves with SVM.
